# CS271-assignment1

Hello My name is Erick Nevarez, I am a Computer Science Major with a Minor in Mathematics.
I learned a lot about github and specially how repositories work, how to use them and how important README's tend to be. I also learned different actions I can do within GitHub and how to take advantage of them. From this class I want to takeaway as much knowledge as I possibly can and create a good foundation for my future classes. I want to fully understand OOP in order to become a good Software Engineer and make this class the start of my career.
